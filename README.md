This is repository containing my python scripts used for analysing a chart indicator trading strategy applicable across many different markets and timeframes. 
There are 3 main strategies, each with a seperate buy and sell scripts for each strategy, making a total of 6 projects.
These strategies are Kelter Channel, RSI and Moving Averages
This repository also contains the scripts i use to extract market OHLC data from a broker/data provider via API's and scripts used to clean the data by removing times/intervals that i do not want and also consolidating 1 minute time frame data into any time frame of my choosing e.g converting 1 minute chart data into 3 minute chart data.
